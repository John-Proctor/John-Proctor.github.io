      <h1 class="w3-text-red">Project One</h1>
      <p>When beginning this project I was very intimidated, since even though I have experience coding I have never worked in HTML or anything else to do with web development. It turns out that those concerns were properly held since I had several problems that I needed to overcome to finish this assignment. However in retrospect the majority of my problems came through me making mistakes that costed me time, and patience. While the assignment it's self was not bad at all.</p>
        <h2 class="w3-text-red">The Start</h2>
        <p>To start, I followed the Madison Dunaway's instructions. They were very helpful at first. They were very helpful getting to the point of creating an account on Github, and creating a repository. However at this point I ran into my first problem that being the fact that I have a windows computer which doesnt have the versitility within it's command prompt as a Mac. To resolve this I had to download git. </p>
        <img src="Screenshot%20(8).png" alt="Git download website" style="width:800px;height:550px;">
        <p>After downloading git I was able to use that in a very similar manner to the way that Madison used the command prompt on the Mac.  Now with the command prompt problem solved I just needed to save the reposiory to a documents folder for this class. </p>
        <img src="Screenshot%20(7).png" alt="Code saving the repository and giving the first push to website" style="width:1100px;height:650px;">
        <h2 class="w3-text-red">The Website Design</h2>
        <p>With the repository intilized I was in the perfect position to simply find a preset edit a couple of things, push it or be done. However that is not at all how it ended up going. To start with when using brakets, a text editing software reccommened to the class because of how friendly it is to web design, I couldn't access parts of the functionality. Most importantly to me initially was the fact that the live previes feature for whatever reason was not showing any results for the code that I put in. The code that I was putting in came from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp"> w3schools.com</a>.</p>
        <img src="Screenshot%20(10).png" alt="screenshot of W3schools template I used" style="width:1100px;height:500px;">
        <p>At that point, I was worried, but figured that I could just push the template to the website, and then just do the work very slowly from there. That is when I noticed the much larger problem that I did not have a push command available to me at all on Brackets. I won't keep you in suspence, what ended up being my problem was that I had opened the file, and not the folder where the repository was. So what I think I was trying to do was just push and .html out into the ether. Once I finished that I got to work on making the template my own.</p>
